## 🎨 Customization (Make It Yours)

### CSS Variables for Theming
```css
:root {
    --primary-black: #000000;      /* The void */
    --primary-white: #ffffff;      /* Pure light */
    --cosmic-gray: #1a1a1a;        /* Space gray */
    --stellar-gray: #2a2a2a;       /* Star gray */
    --text-primary: #ffffff;       /* Readable text */
    --text-secondary: #cccccc;     /* Less important stuff */
    --glow-white: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3); /* The glow */
}
```

### Configuration Options
```javascript
const galaxy = new GalaxyJS({
    debug: false,           // Set to true if you like console spam
    autoInit: true,         // Auto-initialize everything
    particleCount: 100,     // How many particles (more = slower)
    trailLength: 20,        // Mouse trail length
    animationSpeed: 1.0     // Speed multiplier
});
```

## 📱 Responsive Design (Because Mobile Matters)

GalaxyJS works on everything:
- **Desktop** - Full cosmic experience
- **Tablet** - Touch-optimized cosmic experience  
- **Mobile** - Simplified but still cosmic experience
- **Smart Fridge** - Probably not, but who knows?

## 🔧 API Reference (For The Nerds)

### Core Methods

```javascript
// Initialize the universe
const galaxy = new GalaxyJS(options);

// Manual control
galaxy.init();      // Start everything
galaxy.pause();     // Pause all animations
galaxy.resume();    // Resume all animations
galaxy.clear();     // Clear everything (nuclear option)
```

### Event System
```javascript
// Listen for cosmic events
document.addEventListener('galaxyjs:initialized', (e) => {
    console.log('The universe is ready!', e.detail);
});

document.addEventListener('galaxyjs:mousemove', (e) => {
    console.log('Mouse moved through space!', e.detail);
});
```

## 🎯 Performance Tips (Keep It Smooth)

1. **Limit Particle Count** - More particles = slower performance (duh)
2. **Disable Heavy Effects on Mobile** - Your phone will thank you
3. **Use CSS Transforms** - Hardware acceleration is your friend
4. **Optimize Canvas Size** - Bigger isn't always better

## 🌟 Browser Support (The Usual Suspects)

- **Chrome 60+** - Works great
- **Firefox 55+** - Also works great  
- **Safari 12+** - Surprisingly works great
- **Edge 79+** - Even Microsoft likes it
